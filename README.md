Abstractâ€”The goal of this work is to build an ADAS (advanced driving assistance system) focusing on driver drowsiness detection, with the goal of alerting drivers of their fatigued condition in order to avert road traffic accidents. It is critical in a driving context that tiredness detection be non-intrusive and that the driver is not distracted by alerts when he or she is not sleepy. Our approach to this open challenge makes use of 60-second picture sequences that are captured with the subject's face visible. Two different techniques have been developed to determine whether the driver is drowsy or not, with the goal of minimizing false positives.
